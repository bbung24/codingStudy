Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would
subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

7.2 Call Center
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager,
and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent
who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the 
call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the
call should be escalated to a director.Design the classes and data structures for 
this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first
available employee.
